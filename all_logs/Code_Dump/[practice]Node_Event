//NODE EVENT PRACTICE

//IMPORTING MODULES
//const logEvents = require("./logEvents")
 const EventEmitter = require('node:events') //could simply be 'events' too. EventEmitter is now a class, not an object.
const emitter = new EventEmitter() //now, it's an object, methods in this object can be used.

//adding function to test run when an event triggers
function responseToEvent(param1, param2) {
    console.log(`The events have been triggered, and thus this respose with ${param1} ${param2}`)
}

//adds a listner, that listens for a specific even emitted to trigger a response.
emitter.on("event emitted", (param1, param2) => {//this function cannot be replaced with the func above, responseToEvent.
    responseToEvent(param1, param2) //might be helpful if function contains longer code that repeats itself.
})

emitter.emit("event emitted", "additional", "parameters")
